# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection and prevention essential.  
This project leverages **machine learning** to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using key health parameters.

By applying and comparing multiple classification algorithms, we identify the most accurate model for prediction — helping improve diagnosis, guide treatment, and promote healthier lives.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- **Objective:** Predict the presence of heart disease (**binary classification**) using patient health metrics.
- **Dataset:** Heart disease patient data containing multiple health-related features and a binary target variable (presence/absence of heart disease).
- **Best Accuracy Achieved:** **87%** using **Logistic Regression**.
