❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection and prevention essential. This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using key health parameters.

By applying and comparing multiple classification algorithms, we identify the most accurate model for prediction — helping to improve diagnosis, guide treatment, and promote healthier lives.

📌 Project Highlights
Objective: Predict the presence of heart disease (binary classification) using patient health metrics.

Dataset: Heart disease patient data containing multiple health-related features and a binary target variable (presence/absence of heart disease).

Best Accuracy Achieved: 87% using Logistic Regression.
